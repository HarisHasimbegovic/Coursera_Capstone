The main goal of this project will be the creation of a tool to help interested parties figure out which neighbourhood of Toronto would be best suited for them depending on their food habits (the type of food that they like)
The interested party will be able to compare various neighbourhoods of Toronto based on food quality and type. 
If per chance you are about to go to Toronto for whatever reason, you can choose where to live and food is a concerning factor, this tool might be able to help you out.
Thank you for reading.
